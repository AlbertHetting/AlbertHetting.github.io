    "aboutproject": "We wanted to explore how we could make an exhibition at the Steno Museum more relevant and attractive for children aged 8–13, regardless of gender. In addition, we explored how to rethink the use of screens in exhibitions aimed at children and young teens, and how to connect the exhibition’s physical content with interactive on screen elements. The goal was to create a relevant, relatable, and exciting museum experience for the target audience, presented through a multimedia interactive design experience.",
